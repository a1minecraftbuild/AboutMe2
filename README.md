## Summary

[Discord]: https://discord.com/

My name is Alexander S.  I'm an ongoing game developer who has the time to make something great, but is too lazy to actually do anything.  I'm returning here because computer science is fun and I am really ready to learn Java.

Hobbies
-

My hobbies include:
* Gaming
* Coding
* Reading

My morning routine:

1. Go to bed after staying up all night.
2. Realize it's not summer anymore and sigh to myself as I get out of bed and dress for school.
3. Ride bus there.

## My Philosophy

*Anything could be considered a waste of time, but the only way to know it's not a waste, is if you're having fun.*
